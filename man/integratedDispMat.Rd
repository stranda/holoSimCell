\description{
calculates the amount of dispersal into a cell based on the popsize and distance of other cells
}
\details{
returns a matrix with the centermost value corresponding to the source and the surrounding cells represent
the probability of dispersal into those cells.  Essentially this produces the dispersal kernel for a single
source population.  The migration matrix could be created by moving the center of this functions output to 
each population to determine dispersal into the others.  The approx parameter is a factor >=1 that determines how many
times to subset the grid squares to better approximate the polar-cartesian conversion
